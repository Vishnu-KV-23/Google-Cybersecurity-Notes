1. **CIA Triad**:
   - **Confidentiality**: Ensures only authorized users can access data. Enforced through strict access controls.
   - **Integrity**: Ensures data remains accurate, authentic, and reliable. Encryption is commonly used to maintain data integrity.
   - **Availability**: Ensures data is accessible to authorized users when needed.

2. **Asset**:
   - An asset is anything valuable to an organization, such as data or applications. 
   - Value is determined by the cost and risk associated with the asset.

3. **NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF)**:
   - A voluntary framework of standards, guidelines, and best practices designed to manage cybersecurity risks.
   - Widely used by security teams to assess both short- and long-term risks.
   - Focuses on protecting valuable organizational assets from threat actors, including internal risks like disgruntled employees.

4. **Threat Actors**:
   - Can originate globally with various motives, including insider threats.
   - A diverse security team helps in identifying and mitigating different types of threats.

### Applications:
- Understanding the CIA triad and NIST CSF can be useful in interviews to explain how organizations secure their assets.
