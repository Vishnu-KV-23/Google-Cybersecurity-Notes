Here are the short notes:

- **Computer Virus**: Malicious code that damages data and software, spreading through programs or documents. Commonly referred to as malware today.
- **Brain Virus (1986)**: Created by the Alvi brothers to track pirated software. It spread globally via infected disks, impacting productivity and operations.
- **Morris Worm (1988)**: Developed by Robert Morris to assess internet size but caused widespread disruption by re-infecting computers, leading to crashes and significant damage.
- **Impact**:
  - **Brain Virus**: Highlighted the need for robust security plans.
  - **Morris Worm**: Led to the creation of Computer Emergency Response Teams (CERTs), which still play a critical role in security.
- **Next Steps**: The course will cover the evolution of attacks in the digital age and the expanded roles of CERTs.
