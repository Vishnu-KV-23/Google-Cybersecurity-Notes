### **Phishing** 🐟

Phishing is like a fishing scam, but instead of catching fish, they’re after your sensitive info! Here are the main flavors:

- **Business Email Compromise (BEC)**: Pretending to be a legit source to steal info or money. Sneaky!
- **Spear Phishing**: Targets specific people/groups—like phishing with precision!
- **Whaling**: They aim BIG by going after execs. 🐋
- **Vishing**: Tricking you through voice calls. Yep, scam calls.
- **Smishing**: Phishing via text. So yeah, sketchy texts, beware!

### **Malware** 👾

This bad boy’s all about causing harm to devices or networks. Why? For money, power, or both!

- **Viruses**: Infects your files and messes with your data when you open something shady.
- **Worms**: Unlike viruses, these guys spread _without_ you doing anything. Just pure chaos.
- **Ransomware**: Locks your data, then demands money to give it back. Classic bad guy move.
- **Spyware**: Spies on your device and steals your info. Creepy, right?

### **Social Engineering** 🤥

It’s all about tricking people (because humans are the weak link, apparently 🤷). They create false trust or authority to get what they want:

- **Social Media Phishing**: They stalk you online and use your info against you.
- **Watering Hole Attack**: They attack websites you visit a lot—setting traps!
- **USB Baiting**: Dropping infected USBs for someone to plug in... like a digital booby trap!
- **Physical Social Engineering**: They fake being an employee or customer to sneak into places they shouldn’t be.

### **Why It Works** 🤔

Social engineering works because... well, humans. We’re trusting, and they exploit that:

- **Authority**: "I’m the boss, do as I say!" Classic.
- **Intimidation**: They use scare tactics to get you to do stuff.
- **Consensus/Social Proof**: “Everyone’s doing it, why aren’t you?”
- **Scarcity**: FOMO, but for limited time offers.
- **Familiarity & Trust**: They build fake connections over time to exploit your trust.
- **Urgency**: “Hurry up, or else!” Yep, creating panic works.
