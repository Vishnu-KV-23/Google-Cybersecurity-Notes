- **Role**: Used together to mitigate threats, reduce risks, and address vulnerabilities with accuracy and urgency.

### Incident Response Playbooks:
- **Purpose**: Guide security professionals through incident response, ensuring structured, compliant, and documented processes.
- **Types**: Playbooks may be tailored to specific attacks (e.g., ransomware, malware, DDoS).

### Playbook Process Example (Malware Attack via SIEM Alert):
1. **Alert Assessment**:
   - Determine alert validity by analyzing log data and metrics.
2. **Containment**:
   - Isolate infected systems to prevent malware spread.
3. **Eradication & Restoration**:
   - Remove traces of malware, restore system and data from clean backup.
4. **Post-Incident Activities**:
   - Document the incident, report to stakeholders and authorities (e.g., FBI for cyber crimes).

### Key Takeaways:
- **Consistency & Adaptability**: Playbooks ensure a consistent response and are frequently updated to handle evolving threats.
- **Continuous Improvement**: Organizations learn from incidents to refine playbooks, improve security, and reduce future risks.
- **Entry-Level Role**: Analysts frequently use playbooks for monitoring and responding to incidents, supporting effective security operations.
