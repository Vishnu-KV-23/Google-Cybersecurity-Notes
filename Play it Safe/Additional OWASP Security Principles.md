1. **Establish Secure Defaults**
   - **Definition**: The optimal security state of an application should be its default configuration for users. It should require extra effort to make the application insecure.
   - **Implication**: Security measures should be built-in by default, ensuring that users are protected without requiring additional configurations.

2. **Fail Securely**
   - **Definition**: When a security control fails or malfunctions, it should default to its most secure option rather than becoming permissive.
   - **Example**: If a firewall fails, it should block all connections instead of accepting any new connections, minimizing potential vulnerabilities during a failure.

3. **Don’t Trust Services**
   - **Definition**: Organizations should not implicitly trust third-party partners' security policies or systems.
   - **Example**: If a third-party vendor manages customer rewards, the organization must verify the accuracy of the vendor's data before sharing it with customers.

4. **Avoid Security by Obscurity**
   - **Definition**: Security should not depend solely on keeping system details hidden. 
   - **Example**: An application’s security should be robust regardless of whether the source code is known. This includes having strong password policies, multiple layers of defense (defense in depth), proper network architecture, and effective fraud and audit controls.

### Key Takeaways
