Here are concise notes on the topics covered regarding OWASP security principles and internal security audits:

### OWASP Security Principles
- **Minimize Attack Surface Area**: Reduce potential vulnerabilities that can be exploited.
- **Principle of Least Privilege**: Users should have the minimum access necessary for their tasks.
- **Defense in Depth**: Implement multiple layers of security controls to mitigate risks.
- **Separation of Duties**: Critical actions require involvement from multiple users to enhance security.
- **Keep Security Simple**: Avoid complex solutions that can introduce security issues.
- **Fix Security Issues Correctly**: Identify root causes of security incidents and ensure effective remediation.

#### Additional OWASP Security Principles
- **Establish Secure Defaults**: Applications should default to the most secure settings.
- **Fail Securely**: When controls fail, they should default to secure options (e.g., a firewall blocking all connections).
- **Donâ€™t Trust Services**: Verify the security of third-party services; do not assume they are secure.
- **Avoid Security by Obscurity**: Security should not depend on keeping details hidden; rely on comprehensive security measures.

### Security Audits
- **Definition**: Review of security controls, policies, and procedures against set expectations.
- **Types**: Internal and external audits; focus on internal audits for entry-level analysts.
- **Purpose**: Improve security posture, identify risks, ensure compliance, and avoid penalties.

#### Common Elements of Internal Audits
1. **Establish Scope and Goals**:
   - Define criteria for the audit, including people, assets, policies, and technologies.
   - Outline security objectives for improvement.

2. **Conduct Risk Assessment**:
   - Identify potential threats, risks, and vulnerabilities to guide security measures.

3. **Complete Controls Assessment**:
   - Review existing assets and evaluate risks.
   - Classify controls into:
     - **Administrative Controls**: Human-focused policies (e.g., password policies).
     - **Technical Controls**: Hardware/software protections (e.g., IDS, encryption).
     - **Physical Controls**: Measures to prevent physical access (e.g., locks, cameras).

4. **Assess Compliance**:
   - Ensure adherence to necessary regulations (e.g., GDPR, PCI DSS).

5. **Communicate Results**:
   - Summarize audit findings, existing risks, compliance needs, and recommendations.

### Goals and Objectives of Security Audits
- Ensure IT practices meet organizational and industry standards.
- Identify areas for remediation and growth.
- Safeguard data and avoid regulatory penalties.

### Factors Affecting Audits
- Industry type, organization size, government regulations, geographical location, and adherence to compliance.

### Role of Frameworks and Controls in Audits
- Frameworks like NIST CSF help organizations prepare for compliance audits.
- Controls (administrative, technical, physical) support alignment with regulatory requirements.

### Audit Checklist Components
- **Scope**: List assessed assets and how audits help achieve goals.
- **Risk Assessment**: Evaluate organizational risks.
- **Conduct Audit**: Assess security of identified assets.
- **Mitigation Plan**: Strategy to reduce risk and potential costs.
- **Communicate Results**: Detailed report of findings and recommendations.

### Key Takeaways
- Security audits are crucial for identifying gaps and improving security.
- Understanding security principles, audit elements, and frameworks is essential for cybersecurity professionals, especially entry-level analysts. 

### Additional Resources
- Explore resources on assessment and auditing in cybersecurity, including IT disaster recovery planning.

These notes summarize the key points from the readings on OWASP security principles and internal security audits.
