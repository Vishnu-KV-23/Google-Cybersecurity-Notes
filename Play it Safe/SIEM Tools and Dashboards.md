#### Overview of SIEM Tools
- SIEM tools are not only used to collect and analyze log data but also to create **dashboards**.

#### SIEM Dashboards
- **Functionality**:
  - Present security information in an easy-to-understand format (charts, graphs, tables).
  - Help security analysts quickly access and interpret organizational security data.

- **Analogy**:
  - Similar to weather apps that display data (temperature, precipitation, wind speed) for quick decision-making.

#### Example of Dashboard Usage
- A security analyst receives an alert about a suspicious login attempt:
  - Accesses the SIEM dashboard for details.
  - Discovers 500 login attempts for an account in 5 minutes.
  - Identifies attempts from unusual geographic locations and outside of normal working hours.
  - Utilizes visual representations (timeline, location, time) to assess the situation as suspicious.

#### Metrics in SIEM Dashboards
- **Definition**: Metrics are key technical attributes (response time, availability, failure rate) used to assess software performance.
- Dashboards can be customized to display metrics relevant to various members of the organization.
- Example: A security analyst might create a dashboard to monitor network traffic volume.

#### Importance of SIEM Dashboards
- Provide a comprehensive summary of security-related data.
- Assist security analysts in maintaining the organizationâ€™s security posture.

### Upcoming Topics
- Discussion of common SIEM tools used in the cybersecurity industry.

These notes capture the essential points about SIEM dashboards, their functionalities, usage, and the role of metrics in cybersecurity analysis.



Here are the notes summarizing the future of SIEM tools:

### Future of SIEM Tools

#### Current Role of SIEM Tools
- **Functionality**: Collect and analyze log data for real-time monitoring and tracking of security events.
- **Human Interaction**: Currently requires human analysis for security event assessments.
  
#### Evolution of SIEM Tools
- **Cloud Functionality**: Increasing demand for cloud-hosted and cloud-native environments.
  - **Cloud-Hosted SIEM**: Operated by vendors; organizations access via the internet. Ideal for those not wanting to maintain their own infrastructure.
  - **Cloud-Native SIEM**: Also vendor-managed and accessed online but designed to leverage cloud computing capabilities (availability, flexibility, scalability).

- **Adapting to Technology Changes**:
  - As technology and threat actor tactics evolve, SIEM tools must adapt to manage the increasing cybersecurity attack surface, especially with the rise of IoT (Internet of Things).
  - The growth in interconnected devices means a larger volume of data for threat actors to exploit.

#### Enhancements through AI and Automation
- **AI and Machine Learning**: Expected to improve SIEM capabilities in identifying threats, enhancing dashboard visualizations, and optimizing data storage.
- **Automation**:
  - Implementation of **Security Orchestration, Automation, and Response (SOAR)**:
    - Streamlines response to common security incidents, reducing the need for manual intervention.
    - Allows security analysts to focus on more complex incidents that cannot be automated.
  
- **Interconnectivity**: Expectation for cybersecurity platforms to communicate and interact with one another, although this integration is still a work in progress.

### Key Takeaways
- SIEM tools are crucial for monitoring organizational data.
- As an entry-level security analyst, monitoring SIEM dashboards will likely be a regular task.
- Staying informed about advancements in SIEM technology, such as cloud computing and automation, will aid in adapting to changes in the cybersecurity field. 

These notes highlight the evolution of SIEM tools and their increasing importance in managing cybersecurity risks and enhancing organizational protection.
