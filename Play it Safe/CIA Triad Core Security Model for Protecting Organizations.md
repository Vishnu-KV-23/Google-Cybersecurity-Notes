#### Overview
- The **CIA Triad** is a fundamental model guiding how organizations assess and mitigate risks, threats, and vulnerabilities.
- **Components**: Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability.

#### CIA Triad Components
1. **Confidentiality**
   - **Purpose**: Restrict data access to authorized users only.
   - **Implementation**: Ensures sensitive data is shared on a "need to know" basis.
   - **Example**: In a bank, only authorized personnel can access sensitive financial information.

2. **Integrity**
   - **Purpose**: Ensure data is accurate, authentic, and reliable.
   - **Importance**: Helps verify data's trustworthiness.
   - **Example**: A bank may restrict account access if unusual activity is detected to verify legitimacy.

3. **Availability**
   - **Purpose**: Ensure data is accessible to authorized users when needed.
   - **Implementation**: Systems and networks should operate reliably to provide timely access.
   - **Example**: Banks invest in secure systems so customers can consistently access accounts online.

#### Application in Organizations
- **For Entry-level Analysts**: Using the CIA Triad principles helps protect sensitive assets and reduce risks from attacks, including social engineering, malware, and data theft.
- **Industry Example**: Banks prioritize confidentiality to protect customer information, integrity to verify account authenticity, and availability for continuous access.

#### Key Takeaway
- The **CIA Triad** is essential for shaping security policies and protecting an organization's sensitive assets.
