1. **Minimize the Attack Surface Area**
   - **Definition**: Refers to all potential vulnerabilities that a threat actor could exploit (attack vectors).
   - **Examples of Attack Vectors**: Phishing emails, weak passwords.
   - **Mitigation Strategies**:
     - Disable unnecessary software features.
     - Restrict access to certain assets.
     - Establish complex password requirements.

2. **Principle of Least Privilege**
   - **Definition**: Users should have the minimum access necessary to perform their tasks.
   - **Purpose**: Reduces potential damage from a security breach.
   - **Example**: An entry-level analyst may access log data but not change user permissions, limiting the impact if credentials are compromised.

3. **Defense in Depth**
   - **Definition**: Utilize multiple security controls to address risks and threats in various ways.
   - **Example Controls**:
     - Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA).
     - Firewalls.
     - Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS).
     - Permission settings.

4. **Separation of Duties**
   - **Definition**: Prevents individuals from having excessive privileges that could lead to misuse.
   - **Example**: The person signing paychecks should not also prepare them to reduce fraud risk.

5. **Keep Security Simple**
   - **Definition**: Avoid unnecessarily complicated security solutions.
   - **Rationale**: Complex solutions can be unmanageable and hinder collaborative work.

6. **Fix Security Issues Correctly**
   - **Definition**: Quickly identify root causes of security incidents and correct vulnerabilities.
   - **Example**: If a weak Wi-Fi password leads to a breach, implement stricter password policies.
   - **Importance**: Conduct tests to ensure that repairs are effective and security is restored.

### Conclusion
Understanding these OWASP principles enhances security knowledge and can help security professionals stand out in the field.
