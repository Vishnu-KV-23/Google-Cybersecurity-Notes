#### Overview
- The **CIA Triad** (Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability) guides organizations in designing secure systems and policies.
- Goal: Maintain a strong security posture by managing risks and defending critical assets and data.

#### CIA Triad Components for Analysts

1. **Confidentiality**
   - **Purpose**: Restrict data access to authorized users only.
   - **Principle of Least Privilege**: Limits users' access to only the information necessary for their tasks, enhancing data security.
   - **Example**: Only certain employees access sensitive data depending on their roles.

2. **Integrity**
   - **Purpose**: Ensure data is accurate, authentic, and reliable.
   - **Cryptography**: Secures data by encoding it, protecting against unauthorized tampering.
   - **Encryption**: Converts data into an unreadable format to maintain integrity, e.g., securing internal chat messages.

3. **Availability**
   - **Purpose**: Ensure data is accessible to authorized users when needed.
   - **Remote Access**: Allows employees access based on job requirements, e.g., accounting staff access corporate accounts but not development data.

#### Key Takeaways
- The **CIA Triad** is foundational to a secure security posture and informs how security teams protect organizations and their assets.
