Here are the notes summarizing the first four domains of CISSP:

1. **Security and Risk Management**:
   - Focus: Defining security goals, risk mitigation, compliance, business continuity, and legal regulations.
   - Key Points:
     - Establish security objectives to protect critical assets and data like PII.
     - Risk mitigation involves procedures to minimize the impact of risks.
     - Compliance ensures internal policies align with regulatory standards.
     - Business continuity prepares organizations for disaster recovery.
     - Ethical behavior is crucial to prevent negligence, fraud, and abuse.

2. **Asset Security**:
   - Focus: Securing both digital and physical assets.
   - Key Points:
     - Protect PII or sensitive data in storage, transfer, and destruction.
     - Implement policies for proper storage, maintenance, retention, and disposal.
     - Monitor access to ensure the security posture is strong.

3. **Security Architecture and Engineering**:
   - Focus: Optimizing data security through secure tools, systems, and processes.
   - Key Points:
     - Shared responsibility within organizations is essential for lowering risk.
     - Encourage user reporting of security concerns to address issues quickly.
  
4. **Communication and Network Security**:
   - Focus: Securing physical networks and wireless communications.
   - Key Points:
     - Protect data and communications across all networks (on-site, cloud, remote).
     - Prevent unsafe behaviors like using insecure connections (e.g., public WiFi).
